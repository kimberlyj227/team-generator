## Description
This application runs as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee on the team. The user is able to add managers, engineers, and interns to their team page. After all of the employees are entered into the command line, a team.html file will be written in the outputs folder. The user will be able to open that page in the browser to view their team! 
## Installation
The user will need to run npm install to install inquirer.
## Tests
Testing for the application uses jest.

## Development
To develop this app further, I would like to add validation on the data to make sure that the user inputs the correct type of information. For example, the fields that require a number are given numbers and not strings.
